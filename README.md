# SOF-ELK Web Interface

This project is meant to be an add-on to the amazing SOF-ELK VM created by [@philhagen](https://github.com/philhagen/sof-elk/wiki/Virtual-Machine-README) â€” not a standalone tool. I built this Django based web interface specifically to be cloned and run inside the SOF-ELK VM itself. The idea is simple: give users a graphical UI to help upload, manage, and process log files without needing to mess with the command line every time.

I struggled a lot with uploading and managing files on SOF-ELK over SSH. It was clunky, especially when dealing with large log sets or constantly switching file types. So I built this to make my life easier and figured others might find it helpful too, which is why Iâ€™m sharing it with the community.
And yes, I used AI to help put this together.

## What It Does

- A simple dashboard to keep an eye on system status
- Upload and manage log files directly from the browser
- **New Feature:** View and delete uploaded log files (individually or in bulk)
- Process NetFlow, AWS VPC Flow, and Azure VPC Flow logs
- Manage Elasticsearch indices from the UI
- Update SOF-ELK configurations easily
- Monitor the systemâ€™s health

## ðŸ›  How to Install

1. Clone this repo inside your SOF-ELK VM.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

4. Run the migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. (Optional) Create an admin user:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

7. Access the web interface via your browser at:  
   `http://<your-vm-ip>:8000`

> **Note:** I personally ran into an issue accessing Django from my host machine â€” whether I used NAT or a custom bridged adapter, I just couldnâ€™t reach it.  
> So hereâ€™s what I did: I forwarded port `8080` to `8000` inside the SOF-ELK VM using iptables. This way, Django thinks Iâ€™m hitting it locally on `127.0.0.1`.

Hereâ€™s how I set that up:

```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8000
sudo iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8000
```

Then just run:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

To make these iptables rules stick after a reboot:

```bash
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

Now I can simply open `http://<vm-ip>:8080` from my host machine, and Django behaves like I'm accessing it via `127.0.0.1`.

##  Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Django 5.2+



##  System Paths in SOF-ELK

The web UI respects the original SOF-ELK paths and CLI tools:

- Log dirs: `/logstash/*/`
- Configs: `/etc/logstash/conf.d/*.conf`
- Core repo: `/usr/local/sof-elk/*`
- System tools used:
  - `/usr/local/sbin/sof-elk_clear.py`
  - `/usr/local/sbin/sof-elk_update.sh`
  - `nfdump2sof-elk.sh`
  - `aws-vpcflow2sof-elk.sh`
  - `azure-vpcflow2sof-elk.py`

## Permissions & Security Notes

- The Django app runs with the same privileges as the user starting the server (e.g., `elk_user`).
- **File Uploads & Deletion:** That user must have write permissions to relevant `/logstash/*` subdirectories.
- **Log Processing (NetFlow, etc.):** Requires write access to `/logstash/nfarch/`.
- **Privileged Commands:** For stuff like `sof-elk_update.sh`, make sure the Django server user has **passwordless sudo** access specifically for that command.
- For production, use a proper web server like Nginx or Apache with WSGI and lock down permissions carefully.
